## Shop23:

A shopping app created using React native.  
It will consume a Product List REST API and will exhibit an interface  
similar to a shopping app i.e. filter, sort etc.  
And then we will go from there.

### Changes introduced in this commit:

### Changes in mind to be introduced in the near-future commits:

2. Perform a GET Query for a kind of product.
