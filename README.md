## Shop23:

A shopping app created using React native.  
It will consume a Product List REST API and will exhibit an interface  
similar to a shopping app i.e. filter, sort etc.  
And then we will go from there.

### Changes introduced in this commit:

1. This is an initial commit.
1. Used React Native CLI instead of Expo CLI to create the project.
1. Renamed App.tsx to App.jsx to use Javascript instead of Typescript.
1. Cleaned App.jsx.
1. Installed [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to communicate with a REST API.

### Changes in mind to be introduced in the near-future commits:

1. Create the desired user interface with staged screens and  
   bottom tab navigation.
2. Perform a GET Query for a kind of product.
