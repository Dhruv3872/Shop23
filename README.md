## Shop23:

A shopping app created using React native.  
It consumes a Product List REST API- [dummyjson](https://dummyjson.com/docs) and will exhibit an interface  
similar to a shopping app i.e. filter, sort etc.  
And then we will go from there.

### Changes introduced in this commit:

1. Added eas-cli to create a preview build of the app.

### Changes in mind to be introduced in the near-future commits:

1. The ProductCard components rendered in the adjascent columns  
   are not rendered precisely side-by-side but are rather displaced.  
   Putting a border around the FastImage component shows it clearly.  
   We need to make the two adjascent components symmetric.
1. Include relevant details of the product in the ProductCard.
1. Create the desired user interface.
